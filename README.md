# pirate-get
pirate-get is a convenient command line tool (inspired by APT) to speed up your trip to the Pirate Bay and get your completely legal torrents more quickly.

Tested on Arch Linux mostly. It should work on any other Linux too. Let me know if it doesn't.  
Also tested on OSX (works fine on yosemite)

`--local` option hasn't been tested recently.

## Installation
Make sure you have python 3 installed.
Requires `colorama` for colored output.

Run `./install`

## Usage
See `pirate-get -h` for help.

Watch [this](http://showterm.io/d6f7a0c2a5de1da9ea317) for an example usage.


## Configuration file
You can use a file to override pirate-get's default settings.  
Default is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pirate-get`.
If it does not exist then `$HOME/.config/pirate-get`.

### Default config file
These are the default options:

```INI
[Save]
directory = $PWD                     ; directory where to save files
magnets = false                      ; save each selected magnet link in a .magnet file
torrents = false                     ; save each selected torrent in a .torrent file

[LocalDB]
enabled = false                      ; use a local copy of the pirate bay database
path = ~/downloads/pirate-get/db     ; path of the database

[Misc]
openCommand =                        ; specify a custom command for opening the magnet
                                     ; ex. myprogram --open %s
                                     ; %s represent the magnet uri

transmission = false                 ; open magnets with transmission-remote client
colors = true                        ; use colored output
```

Note:
Any command line option will override its respective setting in the config file.
